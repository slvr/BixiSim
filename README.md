This project tasks to create a domain-specific language specifying Montreal's BIXI bike rental and sharing service. The name BIXI is a portmanteau of the words "bike" and "taxi", highlighting the concept of renting a bicycle andusing just as one would use a taxi.  
This language was created using the JetBrains MPS projectional editor, with the specific goal of defining 
1. The language's abstract syntax via the underlying tree behind the editor;
2. The language's concrete syntax via the incorporated _editor_ modules;
3. *[SEMANTICS OR TRANSFORMATION]*.
